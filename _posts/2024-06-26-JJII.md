Submitted a short abstract + poster version of my final master thesis "GPianoroll: a Deep Learning System with Human Feedback for Music Generation". Local congress hosted at our campus by the I3A for a day. An afternoon of yapping with familiar and new faces. Quite excited to present for the first time as an "actual researcher".
